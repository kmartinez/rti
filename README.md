utilities for RTI imaging

You can organise a stream of RTI images from a camera using Phil's RTI Card Importer (best to copy from camera first).

You can run John Cupitt's faster ptmfit on the rti tree using Phil's RTI Processor.

A copy of HP's original PTM fitter is zipped here for use with RTIBuilder to make lp files. Also a copy of RTI Builder (but check CHI site for updates)
